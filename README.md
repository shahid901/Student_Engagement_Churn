# Student Engagement Churn (Data Analysis)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze student engagement and predict churn (dropout) for the Excelerate AI Data Analyst Internship program. The analysis spans four weeks of data-driven exploration, cleaning, and modeling to identify factors contributing to student engagement and disengagement. By leveraging data science techniques, the project provides actionable insights to enhance student retention and engagement strategies.

## 📈 Week 1: Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
### Overview
In the first week, we focused on cleaning the raw dataset to ensure it was suitable for further analysis. Key tasks included handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting formatting issues, and standardizing data types. Feature engineering techniques were also applied to extract meaningful insights from existing data columns.

### Key Steps
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Addressed missing values using imputation techniques.
  - Removed unnecessary columns and standardized data types.
  - Validated entries for accuracy, including dates, numerical fields, and categorical data.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created new features such as "Age of Learner," "Engagement Duration," and "Time Since Last Engagement."
  - Normalized engagement-related metrics to prepare for modeling.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Overview
In the second week, we conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights within the cleaned dataset. This phase laid the foundation for hypothesis generation and feature selection for predictive modeling.

### Key Analyses
- **Demographic Insights**:
  - Analyzed learner demographics like age, gender, and engagement patterns.
  - Identified high engagement among specific age groups (18-28 years).
- **Temporal Trends**:
  - Seasonal analysis of engagement scores, sign-up trends, and engagement duration.
  - Observed peak engagement in specific months (e.g., July) and days (e.g., Thursday).
- **Advanced Visualizations**:
  - Generated correlation heatmaps, PCA plots, and clustering (K-Means) to identify underlying data structures.
  - Conducted cohort analysis to track engagement over time.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
